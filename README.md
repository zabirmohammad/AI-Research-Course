# 🚀 Comprehensive Curriculum for Aspiring AI Researchers

## 💡 Overview

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **[Your Institution/Class Name]** AI Research Course!

This curriculum provides a practical, code-first path to foundational and advanced topics in modern Artificial Intelligence. We focus on building a strong theoretical understanding while implementing real-world projects in key domains like **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 🎓 Course Objectives

This course is designed to transition students from Python fundamentals to implementing state-of-the-art AI models. By the end, students will be able to:

* **Master Python for AI:** Confidently use essential libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras) and apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to structure AI projects.
* **Implement Deep Learning Models:** Build and train core deep learning architectures, starting with linear models and advancing to **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
* **Apply Computer Vision Techniques:** Utilize concepts like data augmentation and **Transfer Learning** (e.g., using ResNet) to efficiently solve image classification tasks.
* **Develop NLP Systems:** Work with modern sequence modeling techniques, including **Word Embeddings** and the **Transformer Architecture** for tasks like machine translation.

## 📚 Course Syllabus and File Structure

The course content is divided into chronological, topic-based modules, each corresponding to a numbered folder.

| Module | Topic | Folder | Key Concepts Covered | Files Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Python Fundamentals & OOP** | `01_Python_Fundamentals/` | Data Types, Control Flow, Functions, and **Classes** (OOP). | `python_crash_course_final_.py` |
| **02** | **Deep Learning & Computer Vision** | `02_Deep_Learning_CV/` | Linear Regression, CNNs (LeNet), Data Preprocessing, and **ResNet Transfer Learning**. | `intro_to_deep_learning_(computer_vision).py` |
| **03** | **Natural Language Processing** | `03_Natural_Language_Processing/` | Word Encoding, Tokenization, Keras Text Preprocessing, and the **Transformer Model**. | `npl_class.py` |

### **Note on File Types**

Each module contains:
* **`.py` scripts:** Clean, runnable Python code files.
* **`.ipynb` notebooks:** (Coming soon) Jupyter notebooks that combine code, output, and detailed lecture notes/explanations.
